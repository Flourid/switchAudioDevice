# switchAudioDevice
Switch the default audio device via shortcut.

This is an AutoHotKey script and requires AutoHotKey.

If you clone this repo you'll have to edit the names of your audio devices (line 8,9,14,15), the location of the icons (line 10,16) and the location of SoundVolumeView.exe (line 81).
You'll also need the AudioDeviceCmdlets (https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets) which can be installed via 
    
    Install-Module -Name AudioDeviceCmdlets
    
The shortcut to switch can be changed in line 80 (see autohotkey syntax).
